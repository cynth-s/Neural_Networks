# ECS659U/P Coursework â€“ The problem

# The problem :
1) Fashion-MNIST classification 
2) Classify every image in terms of 1 out of 10 classes 
3) Standard tasks for lectures and labs
4) Build a model on training set and evaluate on test

# Overview of model
1) An architecture to process images based on MLPs.
2) Model architecture consists of Stem, backbone, classifier

# The Stem
1) Takes as input an image <i>I</i> of size <i>H x W</i> and divides into N<sub>p</sub> non-overlapping patches.
2) Each patch P<sub>i,j</sub> has <i>K x K</i> dimensions.
3) Each patch is vectorized, then transformed to a feature vector of dimesions <i>d: x<sub>i,j</sub> = f(p<sub>i,j</sub>)</i>
4) <i>f</i> can be a single layer or a single hidden layer MLP.
5) All features are stored in a matrix <i> X belongs R <sup>N<sub>p</sub>Xd</sup></i>

# The backbone
1) Consists of <i>N</i> blocks. The basic implementation for each block B<sub>i</sub> consists of two MLPs.
2) The first MLP
